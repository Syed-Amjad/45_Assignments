//22. Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make 
// one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. 
// Make sure you correct the error before closing the program.

//Making intentional Array Error by calling wrong index i.e 3 instead of 2
console.log("\n" + guestList[3]);

//Now correcting this error by calling the right index
